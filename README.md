# UW Work

The idea here is to create a place to archive the code I make for analyzing
the data behind whatever papers come out of my time at UW. Reproducibility and
all that, wot?  Each article has its own repository. Where possible, I'll 
include the data necessary to run the scripts. There are some analyses that
included an extensive manual process. I'll do my best to explain what I did
there, but it isn't going to be pretty...

## Paper #1

## Paper #2
